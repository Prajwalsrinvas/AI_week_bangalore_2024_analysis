🪤 Why Fondant?#
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fondant is a data framework that enables collaborative dataset building. It is designed for developing and crafting datasets together, sharing reusable operations and complete data processing trees.

Fondant enables you to initialize datasets, apply various operations on them, and load datasets from other users. It assists in executing operations on managed services, sharing operations with others, and keeping track of your dataset versions. Fondant makes this all possible without moving the source data.

💨 Getting Started#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fondant allows you to easily define workflows comprised of both reusable and custom components. The following example uses the reusable `load_from_hf_hub component` to load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub and process it using a custom component that will resize the images resulting in a new dataset.

```
import pyarrow as pa

from fondant.dataset import Dataset

# initialize a dataset by loading data from the Hugging Face Hub
raw_data = Dataset.create(
    "load_from_hf_hub",
    arguments={
        "dataset_name": "fondant-ai/fondant-cc-25m",
        "n_rows_to_load": 100,
    },
    produces={
        "alt_text": pa.string(),
        "image_url": pa.string(),
        "license_location": pa.string(),
        "license_type": pa.string(),
        "webpage_url": pa.string(),
        "surt_url": pa.string(),
        "top_level_domain": pa.string(),
    },
)
# add an operation to download the images from the urls
images = raw_data.apply(
    "download_images",
    arguments={
        "input_partition_rows": 100,
        "resize_mode": "no",
    },
)
# add an operation to resize the images
dataset = images.apply(
    "resize_images",
    arguments={
        "resize_width": 128,
        "resize_height": 128,
    },
)
```

Custom use cases require the creation of custom components. Check out our **step by step guide** to learn more about how to build custom pipelines and components.(back to top)

### Running your pipeline#

Once you have a pipeline you can easily run (and compile) it by using the built-in CLI:

```
fondantrunlocalpipeline.py
```

To see all available runners and arguments you can check the fondant CLI help pages

Or for a specific subcommand:

```
fondant<subcommand>--help
```

(back to top)

🪄 How Fondant works#
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Dataset**: The building blocks, a dataset is a collection of columns. Fondant operates uniquely via datasets. We start with a dataset, we augment it into a new dataset and we end with a dataset. Fondant optimizes the data transfer by storing and loading columns as needed. While also processing based on the available partitions. The aim is to make these datasets sharable and allow users to create their own datasets based on others.
*   **Operation**: A transformation to be applied on a dataset resulting in a new dataset. The operation will load needed columns and produce new/altered columns. A transformation can be anything from loading, filtering, adding a column, writing etc. Fondant also makes operations sharable so you can easily use an operation in your workflow.
*   **Shareable trees**: Datasets are a result of applying operations on other datasets. The full lineage is baked in. This allows for sharing not just the end product but the full history, users can also easily continue based on a dataset or branch off of an existing graph.

🧩 Key Features#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's what Fondant brings to the table: - 🔧 Plug ‘n’ play composable data processing workflows - 🧩 Library containing off-the-shelf reusable components - 🐼 A simple Pandas based dataframe interface for creating custom components - 📊 Built-in lineage, caching, and data explorer - 🚀 Production-ready, scalable deployment - ☁️ Integration with runners across different clouds (Vertex on Google Cloud, Sagemaker on AWS, Kubeflow on any k8s cluster)

👉 **Check our Component Hub for an overview of all available components**

(back to top)

🪄 Example pipelines#
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have created several ready-made example pipelines for you to use as a starting point for exploring Fondant. They are hosted as separate repositories containing a notebook tutorial so you can easily clone them and get started:

📖 **RAG tuning pipeline**  
End-to-end Fondant pipelines to index and evaluate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

🛋️ **ControlNet Interior Design Pipeline**  
An end-to-end Fondant pipeline to collect and process data for the fine-tuning of a ControlNet model, focusing on images related to interior design.

🖼️ **Filter creative common license images**  
An end-to-end Fondant pipeline that starts from our Fondant-CC-25M creative commons image dataset and filters and downloads the desired images.

⚒️ Installation#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, run the basic Fondant installation:

Fondant also includes extra dependencies for specific runners, storage integrations and publishing components to registries. The dependencies for the local runner (docker) is included by default.

For more detailed installation options, check the **installation page**on our documentation.

FAQS

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

#### 1\. Does Helium replace Shopify?

Nope! We’re a headless solution, meaning we use Shopify as the backend and only take over the frontend. All your existing Shopify data, apps, and integrations will work seamlessly as before.

#### 2\. Will I have to replace my existing website?

We’d love for you to go fully headless with Helium, but we understand it's a big leap. That’s why we offer plans that let you A/B test with Helium first and switch completely when you’re ready and confident.

#### 3\.  How much effort will it take on my end?

Barely any! Thanks to our AI and no-code tech stack, it won’t take more than 4 hours of your active bandwidth. Sit back and watch the magic happen.

#### 4\.   Is it GDPR compliant?

Absolutely! We don’t attach identity to any visitor sessions and store data securely on your Shopify backend. Privacy and compliance are our top priorities.

#### 5\. How do you charge?

We keep it flexible and accessible. Our pricing is based on the number of monthly visitors, ensuring it’s tailored to your brand’s needs and growth.

#### 6\. Can I customize the look and feel of my site with Helium?

100%! Our no-code headless tech stack makes it easy to replicate and enhance your brand’s unique theme and design language, creating a seamless and immersive experience for your visitors.

Utilize pre-configured VS Code IDE or bring your own IDE to seamlessly work on your code

###### Backend as a Service (BaaS)

Data, Content and BFF
---------------------

Automatically generate REST, GraphQL , OData and gRPC APIs based on entity definitions without any coding.

Content APIs allow you to store Headless Content (CMS), image transformations and video transformations seamlessly.

Backend for Frontend (BFF) allows developers to perform API stitching through AI assisted configurations.

###### DevSecOps & SREs

Zero Ops Environments
---------------------

AI assisted one click deployments can be executed through declarative definitions of environments and can handle simple(single container) to complex(Kubernetes) deployments.

AI managed anomaly detection of infrastructure to identify performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, auto scaling and self-healing.

###### Thoughtful AI

Our scalable LLM gateway allows you to interact with multiple multi-modal foundational models to quickly develop LLM based applications.

Private models trained/tuned on proprietary enterprise data in a declarative format without coding.

Natural Language chatbots can be created utilizing private and foundational models to provide conversational interfaces.

###### Automations

Intelligent API Integrations and Workflows
------------------------------------------

AI Integration engine generates API integrations by consuming external documentation, Open API or RAML spec. Integrations can be simple like APIs only or complex with data storage and pipelines.

###### Building Blocks

How is kis.ai different?
------------------------

#### Fully functional complete code

AI coding partner generates fully functional production ready code thereby saving developers time instead of stitching together solutions from code snippets in other copilots.

#### Deterministic code

Narrow AI agents are trained to perform specific tasks in defined formats, ensuring deterministic code generation with minimal hallucinations.

#### Low Code Maintenance

The platform's AI maintains the code generated or written by developers, thereby reducing the burden on the developers.

#### No Vendor Lock-in

kis.ai doesn't impose proprietary formats on developers; most code on the platform can be written using YAML configurations, with customizations achievable using JavaScript.

#### Pro Code

Integrate your own code and frontend frameworks with the code generated on the platform. The AI coding assistant maintains all definitions of external code and informs about code changes.

#### Supply Chain Security

External dependencies are accessed through Package Registries with white-listed packages and versions, reducing the risk of external security attacks.

    Building in stealth

*   "We are using Portkey in **staging and production**, works really well so far. With reporting and observability being so bad on openAI and Azure, portkey really helps get **visibility** into how and where we are using GPT which becomes a problem as you start using it **at scale** within a company and product."

    ### Swapan R

    Building Haptik.ai

*   "I really like Portkey so far. I am getting all the queries I made saved in portkey out of box. Integration is super quick if using openai directly. And basic analytics around costing is also useful. OpenAi fails often and I can set portkey to fallback to azure as well."

Leveraging Codebase Knowledge Graphs for Agentic Code Generation

This blog explores how knowledge graphs can help language models generate code with better context by understanding the entire codebase. It discusses challenges like duplicating functionality, violating design patterns, and missing business requirements. The approach involves mapping function relationships, providing runtime code fetches, and delivering function-level explanations via a vector database for agents to query. This system optimizes code generation by providing detailed, dynamic context to avoid redundant, inconsistent code and ensure alignment with design and business logic across complex codebases.
